### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


<p> I am currently working on the last assignment before the christmas holidays :christmas_tree: and looking forward too many new assignments in the new year as a second year student at the front-end developer course at Noroff School of technology and digital media.</p> 
<p>  Iâ€™m currently learning javascript and REST api and practising my skills in HTML and CSS.</p> 
<p>  Iâ€™m looking for help with javascript and REST api.</p> 
</p> Ask me about basic HTML and CSS.</p> 
 <p> Fun fact: I love coffee, christmas, and yoga. I am quite new at coding, but did actually learn basic HTML taking a course called multimediadesign back in 2004.</p>  
  <p>I am also a photographer, and I love colors, design, fonts and animations.
