### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
- I am currently working on the last assignment before the christmas holidays and looking forward for many new assignments in the new year as a second year student of the front-end devenoper course at Noroff education.
- Iâ€™m currently learning javascript and REST api and practising my skills in HTML and CSS.
- Iâ€™m looking for help with javascript and REST api.
- Ask me about basic HTML and CSS.
- If you want to contact me you can send me an email: post@fotograf-ms.com 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love coffee, christmas, and people. I am quite new at coding, but did actually learn basic HTML taking a course called Multimediadesign back in 2004. Many things have changed since then, but did learn some of the basic HTML back then.

I am also a photographer, and I lover colors, design, fonts and animations.
