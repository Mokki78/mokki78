### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


<p> I am a second year student of front-end development at Noroff School of technology and digital media.</p> 
<p>  Iâ€™m currently learning javascript and REST api and practising my skills in HTML and CSS.</p> 
</p> Ask me about basic HTML and CSS.</p> 
 <p> Fun fact: I love coffee, and yoga, traveling, photography.</p>  
  <p>I also love colors, design, fonts and animations.
