### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p> I finished a 2 years course in front-end development at Noroff school
 of Technology and Digital media in December 2023, and I am currently doing the UI Design course at same school, finishing in December 2024.</p> 
<p>Through these two last years I have learned about UI, UX, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Boostrap, PHP, Wordpress and headless Wordpress, API and much, much more.
It has been challenging, but also so much fun, and I have loved learning. Now I am looking forward to learning even more, and hopefully geting a job soon.

<p> Fun fact: I love â˜•, yoga, travelling, ðŸŽµ & ðŸ“· .</p>
