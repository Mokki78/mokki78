### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p> I have finished a 2 years course in front-end development and a 1 year course in UI Design at Noroff school
 of Technology and Digital media, and I am now job hunting.</p> 
<p>Through these three last years I have learned about UI, UX, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, React, Boostrap, PHP, responsive design, Wordpress and headless Wordpress, API and much, much more.
It has been challenging, but also so much fun, and I am now looking forward to learning even more, in my next projects.

<p> Fun fact: I love â˜•, yoga, travelling, ðŸŽµ & ðŸ“· .</p>
